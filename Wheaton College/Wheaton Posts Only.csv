video,post_page_54942390562,Today Wheaton College joined “Bells Across the Land_” a commemoration for the ending of the Civil War 150 years ago_ on April 9_ 1865. Under the direction of the National Park Service_ the bells were rung first at the Appomattox Court House at 3:00 p.m. EDST_ where on that date the Civil War formally ended in the historic meeting between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee.  At 2:15 CDST_ our Tower bell rang out slowly for one minute to commemorate the ending of our national conflict and our continued determination to make “liberty and justice for all” a reality for people of all ethnicities. Over one hundred fifty years ago_ Wheaton College saw students leave school to fight_ many never to return. Yet_ the tragic struggle helped bring about the abolition of slavery in the United States. The healing process continues to this day_ including in the church_ by the power of the living Christ.,https://fbcdn-vthumb-a.akamaihd.net/hvthumb-ak-xpt1/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/11000240_10152679693345563_1806342817_n.jpg?oh=7d2f391c26cb685f3aca95cfe3dab202&oe=55A5FFD8&__gda__=1440367939_a9c72f48b94844f290550c1beba2a1d9,https://www.facebook.com/wheatoncollege.il/videos/10152679692490563/,facebook.com,2015-04-09T21:04:17+0000,1428613457,4/9/2015 23:04,197,200,7,7,7,0,51,3,258,54942390562_10152679692490563,https://www.facebook.com/54942390562/posts/10152679692490563

photo,post_page_54942390562,April 3 Image of the Week  Christian baptism is an act filled with symbolism. The practice of baptism by immersing under water symbolizes how our old natures are buried with Christ (going under the water)_ and how we_ like Jesus_ are raised to life again by the work he did on the cross (coming out of the water). How very appropriate during Holy Week as we look at the events that led to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus_ to realize that_ just as with baptism_ we are a part of this story.

Many students take advantage of a wide variety of cross-cultural experiences. Wheaton also cooperates with other organizations that provide study abroad programs.  While studying with one such partner_ Creation Care Study Program_ Mark Hiben ’15 (right) and Davis Guebert ’15 (left) had the chance to visit Key’s Summit in Fiordland National Park in New Zealand and reflect on the fact that thousands of years ago a glacier formed this beautiful valley.  Mark says that being in New Zealand_ “gave both of us the opportunity to encounter the LORD in new ways_ both by encountering the majesty of the earth_ as well as being challenged to think about how we_ as followers of Christ_ are to care for the earth.”,https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/q84/s130x130/1535023_10152639046200563_1959960409358953020_n.jpg?oh=730f97b12435afcd15d52883fb0f0852&oe=55D2FCDA,https://www.facebook.com/wheatoncollege.il/photos/a.10152510812215563.1073741840.54942390562/10152639046200563/?type=1,facebook.com,2015-03-20T16:23:07+0000,1426868587,3/20/2015 17:23,35,35,1,1,1,0,1,0,37,54942390562_10152639054720563,https://www.facebook.com/54942390562/posts/10152639054720563
photo,post_page_54942390562,#TBT Twenty years ago today_ there was a communal experience of the Holy Spirit on the campus of Wheaton College that has become known as the 1995 Wheaton revival_ one of several that occurred on college campuses or in churches at about this time. Two students_ Brandi Maguire and James Hahn_ from Howard Payne University in Texas spoke about a revival on their campus at a World Christian Fellowship (WCF) worship service. After their testimonies individual Wheaton students gave confessions of sin. Soon_ as each individual confessed_ large prayer groups formed around them. This service in the College_s Pierce Chapel continued until 6am on Monday morning. The revival continued until March 23rd. Like the Howard Payne students_ Wheaton College students traveled to other schools telling what happened. This revival was chronicled in _Accounts of a Campus Revival_ by Timothy Beougher and Lyle Dorsett. Read more about the revival from the perspective of Chaplain Stephen Kellough: http://recollections.wheaton.edu/?p=9340  This Sunday night_ the Office of Christian Outreach and World Christian Fellowship will a host time of remembrance and celebration at 7 PM in Pierce Chapel. If you_re in the area_ join us for worship_ prayer_ and testimonies of alumni who were impacted by the 1995 revival. Chappy K_ who was chaplain during that time_ will also be sharing his perspective of that significant event which impacted hundreds of Wheaton students.   Were you at the revival? How did it impact your life?
