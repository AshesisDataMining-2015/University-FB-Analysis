My son is in his 20's and he was so thrilled to have a bandaid on his hand that you couldn't see from 25 yards away! To have something be "flesh toned" and be nowhere near the color of your skin is quite alienating, maybe not if it were the only thing like that but it is one of 100's of tiny assumptions in our society about what is the norm and the norm is always white.	2015-04-07T04:44:12+0000	5

Many students take advantage of a wide variety of cross-cultural experiences. Wheaton also cooperates with other organizations that provide study abroad programs.  While studying with one such partner_ Creation Care Study Program_ Mark Hiben ’15 (right) and Davis Guebert ’15 (left) had the chance to visit Key’s Summit in Fiordland National Park in New Zealand and reflect on the fact that thousands of years ago a glacier formed this beautiful valley.  Mark says that being in New Zealand_ “gave both of us the opportunity to encounter the LORD in new ways_ both by encountering the majesty of the earth_ as well as being challenged to think about how we_ as followers of Christ_ are to care for the earth.”	2015-03-20T16:23:07+0000	10152639046200563_10152639720480563	c3bdf66359a11771d3682c565c5f5c1ed5859f0f	0	mark hiben, hometown hero!	2015-03-20T21:42:23+0000	0

My Freshman year...I remember running there the first night from Traber 4...in my PJs...and feeling the room so filled with the Spirit you could cut it with a knife... I remember worship like a taste of heaven...lots of white people dancing :P... God didn't ask me to confess that week...he asked me to confess to my Koinonia Fellowship a few weeks later and to my youth ministry in front of my siblings a few weeks after that...revival broke out at the retreat... That Thursday night call for full time overseas missions was the first memorable moment I told God I was available to Him...who knew years later He would ask me to pastor... I'm thankful for the real presence of God that settled on our community that spring... :)	2015-03-19T21:17:34+0000	19

The power of darkness, manifest in deception, addiction, false fronts covering deep shame - was broken as everything was brought out into the light. We learned that secrecy and isolation were the enemy's tools to keep us in bondage, and that coming into the Light of Grace (From Father and through the whole Body) broke those chains! CD's and magazines were burned, drugs thrown away, alcohol poured out. So thankful to the One who came to set the captives Free!	2015-03-20T12:48:00+0000	15

I was broken physically, mentally and spiritually. And during this time God brought me to a point where I could no longer flee from Him. On the first night in the back row of Pierce Chapel, I came face to face with my Creator and He led me to expose my sin. There was no fanfare just God showing me my sin and removing it from both of us. And an equally significant experience for me was the final night where there was an appeal for missions. My dear friend Rebecca and I joined the hundreds at the stage in committing our lives to foreign missions. That single event forever changed the direction of my life to a life of surrender and Going where He leads.	2015-03-21T01:21:21+0000	6

I entered Pierce that first night hoping for revival, knowing it was possible but also wary of it being manufactured. It wasn't manufactured. The Holy Spirit manifested Himself in a tangible way that cut many of us to the soul. I did confess sin from the microphone and was thankful for the freedom and prayer that followed. I also remember bursting into tears in a pew at one point, and my roommates Kelly Stewart and Ruth Moore prayed on either side of me as the Lord unleashed years of pain and hurt that I desperately needed to grieve and be healed from. Most importantly, I was counseling a friend the last night of the revival, and as I spoke gospel truths to him, I found I was speaking them to myself as well. For years I had felt enslaved to sin; it was my primary identity and I felt futile to overcome it. That night was the first time I understood that God not only forgave me for what I had done in the past, but He has also forgiven me for how I will sin tomorrow. Such a simple yet profound truth that changed forever how I viewed my identity. I now live in freedom instead of fear and guilt. Romans 6:22: "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life." I so wish I was with you to commemorate this day. Praying for the campus, especially this weekend. Jennifer (Roberts) Biddison '98	2015-03-21T01:34:56+0000	8

I remember feeling so nervous to be so vulnerable and speak sin out into the open -- the public! But the thought of standing there and putting up yet another wall, making up something inane as an attempt to dodge what God was doing -- that thought was worse.

(I was a young writer then and am very tempted to edit myself, but we all started somewhere. My progressive tendencies have only grown, however.) "Do You Believe in Revival?" Several years ago a phenomenon occurred on our college campus which has come to be known familiarly as The Wheaton Revival. Many of us have allowed those several weeks to slowly fade in our memories, while still many more can only ever experience this phenomenon kerygmatically (that is, second-hand). The subject has weighed heavily upon my heart and mind for nearly two years, and although I have wished to address the issue on numerous occasions, I feel that until now my thoughts would only have been a form of unprocessed venting. Time has allowed my emotional responses to settle toward a synthesis of ideas which I hope are a valuable critique; my only hope is that these thoughts do not fall on ears that no longer care. Let me preface this article by insisting that the following is not a cynic's acerbic polemic. Nothing that I am about to say is inconsistent with anything else I have written prior to this week's column. I have been insisting all year long that the Wheaton College community has an unhealthy, idealized understanding of what it means to be a human being. If you disagree with this, just ask yourself why two students attempted suicide last semester. Gravely, one was not unsuccessful. If you want further evidence, then ask yourself why both incidents went virtually unheard throughout our community, swept under the rug, as it were. But if you want the best evidence, then ask yourself why the Wheaton Revival was so 'necessary' in the first place. Why is Wheaton College a community of students so horribly plagued by guilt, that, when the chance arises every 50 years for us to be honest about our every day struggle with sin, vast waves of people flood to a microphone to confess that they are not idealized individuals? That they are, in fact, just like anybody else in the world, human beings. As coincidence would have it, just before I sat down to write this column a good friend of mine asked me, "Do you believe in revival?" I have waited two years to answer that question. My friend was thoroughly surprised by my response. "No." Not a "maybe" or an "it depends." But "No." Flat out "No." I do not believe in revival--at least, not the kind that occurred here several years ago. This does not mean that I am oblivious to the events that took place here several years ago--in fact, I attended virtually every meeting. Neither does this mean that I am convinced that no spiritual good came as the result of those events. But I insist that past, present and future revivals within our community will continue to have virtually non-existent long-term effects unless first we possess a balanced understanding of what it means to be human. I have come to view the revival phenomenon as a kind of sociological tea kettle that occurs when a repressed community has no spout to release its steam. The pressure of unrepressed guilt builds and builds until finally the instrument explodes. That, my friends, is not an orthodox way to make a cup of tea. My friend was quite shocked by my emphatic "no" and said that my answer depended on the fact that I was not in the current midst of a revival. Yet from the numerous experiences I do have from so-called revivals I rather doubt whether an individual in the participatory thralls of revival really has the faculties about them to determine exactly what, in fact, is going on. All of the revivals I have participated in were governed chiefly by individuals with the sincere, yet emotional, desire to be released from the 'weight of sin' that constantly drags upon their being. More and more, though, I am convinced that the only thing being released during revivals is the 'weight of guilt.' The passing of time eventually dissipates the emotional disgorgings of revival and allows us to view this theory with more reasonable clarity. Let me test my theory on anyone who has ever actively participated in a revival. Seriously ask yourself: since that experience have you actually changed the patterns of behavior that you were hoping to cast aside? Or was your experience just a much-needed opportunity to throw away a baggage of guilt that your idealized community forces upon you? Were any of us really profited by knowing how many men on our campus masturbate? I'm being utterly serious. Do you really think that such public confessions are what the New Testament writers had in mind? Our lives are not changed from Dionysian orgiastic whirling dervishes. They change when we take the time--and I mean really take the time--to search our souls concerning the world of thoughts and experiences that surround us, and by seeking out those who are qualified to help people understand what it is exactly that they need to change, and how to go about that change. And, of course, our lives change by the loving, graceful hand of God. I suppose God can begin a process of change during a 'revival', but real change is a process--not an instantaneous microwave miracle. Conversions are not punctilear ends; only punctilear beginnings. I can just about feel those stones whipping by me now. One just whizzed past my ear. What I do know is that no one is likely to produce any evidence that these skeptical thoughts come from the mind of a self-righteous individual. I am a professional sinner and a veteran, at that. I'm not proud of it, yet neither am I unproud of it. I simply accept it as an unfortunate, necessary condition of being. I am not a Protestant, but one of the greatest theological statements I have ever come across is Luther's phrase simul justus et peccator. It means that simultaneously I am saint and sinner. While we are rooted to God, we are also rooted to sin. All Christian thinking must begin from this position. However, the idealized community of Wheaton College is far from being grounded to this most elemental Christian foundation. Perhaps we should change our academic slogan to For Christ and His Simul Justus Kingdom. Maybe I'm not making myself clear enough. How many more suicides should we risk before we incorporate a more balanced understanding of what it means to be human? Some of us can't afford to wait another 48 years.	2015-03-21T16:44:44+0000	6

It is interesting to see how many people, like me, were skeptical of the community manufacturing an experience. All year we had been praying for revival. My fellow Freshman believed this would be the year, and I remember an upperclassman telling me every incoming class thought they would be the ones to bring it. (As if any of us can “bring revival.”) I was skeptical. I prayed. I hoped for revival. I quoted 2 Chronicles 7:14. But I seriously doubted we would see anything. When I saw the mics set up in the aisles it felt like confirmation, but what followed could not have been forced. In years since I have been blessed to experience other outpourings as well as experiences that were forced. I spent some time studying revival and one of the things I noticed was when God pours out his Spirit we can either focus inward or outward. The movements of God that fail inevitably do so because they choose to focus on the experience itself. But the ones that have a lasting impact focus outward. They ask, "What does God want us to do from here?" The outpouring of God's Spirit is always a beginning, not an end. (I think someone said that the final night at College Church.) I remember someone went to Blanchard and counted the people who were in the mission field from each class. And I remember a fresh call to be bearers of light in the world. If you were there one of those nights or if you have been touched by anything written hear or said tomorrow night, will you join me in a renewed focus to be light, to be so immersed in the presence of God that people can't even stand next to us without getting a little wet?	2015-03-21T20:37:49+0000	5

I knew nothing of Wheaton or the like growing up but my conversion at a large university eventually led me to becoming a Wheatonite. God was with me before, during and since... However, in a very special and acute way, I have told the story of what I saw at Wheaton those 5 nights countless times in the past 20 years gathered around student ministry, student witness, student mission, and student revival in such a way that it seems, looking back, it was a life defining moment. In effect (in the best sort of way) it 'ruined' me because I have been talking it up and searching for it (for God's material presences visiting people and particularly students) ever since! To bear witness to it, I knew then, as I do now, that I might not see anything like it again in my lifetime. If I do not that is okay, I continue to feel the weight of His glory and am merely thankful for the mysterious timing and privileged moment when indeed God came near to a college campus. Glory. Come Lord Jesus come.	2015-03-21T20:55:25+0000	3
