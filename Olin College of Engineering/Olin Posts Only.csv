photo,post_page_73089331857,Olin and Babson born startup Indico Data Solutions has been working hard on their product and practice pitches since being initiated into Techstars Boston Fall 2014 class. All of their hard work was tested this morning during the Boston Techstars Demo Day where they pitched to a room full of investors at the House of Blues in Boston. Below is the team standing in front of a bus of Olin students that showed up to cheer on their classmates!  Indico is creating “productivity tools for data scientists at small and medium businesses by uniquely automating parts of their workflow. indico is bringing tools and workflow to machine learning_ making every programmer a 10x data scientist.”  Not only did the team rock their pitches_ they also announced that they closed a $3 million seed round!
