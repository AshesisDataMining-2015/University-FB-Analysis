As much as I would love the full 100% off, now that Olin has / is getting such a great reputation, I think it makes sense that the discount be reduced (but no more until my freshman graduates!). It's still an incredible value in engineering education. And, I would think that having paying students adds to the perceived value and reputation of the school.",2014-11-20T19:45:52+0000,0
