Finally, choice is cherished and willing minds can be reminded and inspired by one of their own to be bold, ingenious and determined towards the path of making the right difference...now! I cannot forget that day you called me to confirm I had been admitted to Ashesi. It taught me leadership before my first Leadership Seminar class. It's my turn, along with several others with the Ashesi stripes, to show what #madeinAshesi means. Thanks for making that possible. Here's to long life and even greater accomplishments.

Aku Nitip Dong Ada sepasang pengantin baru yang akan menikmati malam pertama, si istri seorang yang sangat kolot dan penakut untuk melakukan hubungan sex, karena dia dengar bahwa hubungan sex itu awalnya akan terasa sangat sakit. Maka pada malam pertama sang suami gagal untuk berhubungan. malam keduapun gagal lagi, demikian seterusnya sampai hari ke 6. Pada hari ke 7, malam-malam si istri bangun dan berdiri hendak meninggalkan tempat tidur, si suami heran dan bertanya : Suami : �Mau kemana dik?� Istri : �Mau ke kamar mandi mas, buang air kecil� Suami : �Aku nitip donk� Istri : �Gimana caranya mas?� suami : �Gampang� gini aku kasih tahu caranya� Akhirnya berhasillah sang suami menyalurkan hasratnya yang selama ini terpendam. Setelah selesai, si istri kekamar mandi sedang si suami tidur lagi. Besoknya, malam-malam si suami kaget ketika istrinya membangunkan : Istri : �Mas-mas bangun..� Suami : �Ada apa dik malam-malam bangunin saya?� Istri : �Nggak mas� cuma tanya.. mau titip lagi nggak, soalnya aku mau ke kamar mandi lagi�	2015-03-02T20:00:22+0000	0

No matter how much an effort is made to run away from ourselves we must remember we cannot forever run away from our selves and our origin. We can only build a better African if only we are united as a team to collaboratively work together. The Diversity of all Africans at Ashesi is an effort and step in the journey to make Africa united.
